Curation made easy! Create "zones" then add and order your content!

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to help you curate your content. 

Assign and order stories within zones that you create, edit, and delete. Then use the handy API functions to retrieve and display your content in your theme. Or for those who are a bit code-averse, try the handy widget.

Key features included in the plugin:

* Add/edit/delete zones
* Add/remove posts (or any custom post type) to/from zones
* Order posts in any given zone
* Limit capabilities on who can add/edit/delete zones vs add content to zones
* Locking mechanism, so only one user can edit a zone at a time (to avoid conflicts)
* Idle control, so people can't keep the zoninator locked

This plugin was built by [Mohammad Jangda](http://digitalize.ca) in conjunction with [William Davis](http://wpdavis.com/) and the [Bangor Daily News](http://www.bangordailynews.com/).
